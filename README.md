## Dataset Information

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.<br>

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.<br>

## Attribute Information

### The columns in this dataset are:<br>

1. Id<br>
2. Sepal Length Cm<br>
3. Sepal Width Cm<br>
4. Petal Length Cm<br>
5. Petal Width Cm<br>
6. Species<br>

### Target Variable

The target variable is 'species' which has three species of iris flowers: <b>Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.</b>

Information on more than 180,000 Terrorist Attacks<br>

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

## Task Completed:

1. Importing Libraries

2. Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization

3. Conclusion
